              <h5>Dept. Engineering, Univ. of Cambridge</h5>
              <h5>
In the summers of 1995, 1996, and 1999, Dr Phillip Stanley-Marbell worked as an intern / engineer at Bell Labs (Murray Hill, NJ), first in the Microelectronics Division, and then in the Data Networking Division, on a project spun out by the research group that created the C programming language, the Unix, Inferno, and Plan 9 operating systems, and much more.  Dr Phillip Stanley-Marbell spent 2006–2008 at Technische Universiteit Eindhoven in the Netherlands, joined IBM Research in Zürich, Switzerland, as a permanent Research Staff Member from 2008–2012, and then joined Apple in Cupertino from 2012–2014. Dr Phillip Stanley-Marbell moved back to academia in 2014: Dr Phillip Stanley-Marbell was in the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) from 2014-2017 and joined the University of Cambridge as a faculty member in 2017. Since 2018, Dr Phillip Stanley-Marbell us also a faculty fellow at the Alan Turing Institute for Data Science and Artificial Intelligence in London.
He leads the Physical Computation Laboratory, a research group with about a dozen members (three postdocs, two directly-supervised PhD students, two PhD project students from the Faculty of Mathematics, and five M.Eng./M.Res./IIB students from the Nano DTC, Graphene CDT, and elsewhere). He teaches one third year / IIA project course (RISC-V Processor Design), one fourth-year / IIB course (Embedded Systems), and serve as a cohort leader for the Part IA Integrated Electrical Project. Additionally, He is leading the Embedded Systems Technology-Enabled Learning (TEL) Pilot Program in Cooperation with the Cambridge University Press and edX.
His research exploits information about the physical world to make more efficient computing systems that interact with nature. This requires a combination of theory (applied mathematics) and hardware (circuits and computer architecture). His research involves equal parts of equations, proofs, circuits, and hardware prototypes. He spent some time in the mid-nineties working at Bell-Labs in the group that created C, C++, and Unix.

              <h5>
Dr. Rajendran is an assistant professor in Electrical and Computer Engineering of Texas A&M Univ.
Dr. Rajendran focus on addressing the security problems in hardware design by developing novel design-automation algorithms and circuit techniques to ensure the trustworthiness of computers with provable security guarantees.  The broad goals of Dr. Rajendran's research are to address the general problem of hardware security more holistically. By empowering hardware with security techniques, Dr. Rajendran's research has been: (i) transferring control over a hardware design back to the fabless chip designers, who had relinquished their control to reduce manufacturing cost by outsourcing;  (ii) ensuring the trustworthiness and security of electronic components; (iii) successfully combating the rogue elements as they intrude into the supply chain; (iv) developing tools and techniques to enforce security of hardware; (v) exposing the security capabilities of emerging technologies; (vi) detecting and patching security vulnerabilities in System-on-Chips (SoCs).
He is now working on: Supply-chain security: Logic locking, Split manufacturing, Camouflaging, and Security of System-on-Chips

          <p>
          In this talk, I will give an overview of our recent efforts leveraging modern AI advancement with domain-specific customizations for agile IC physical design and manufacturing closure. I will first show how we leverage deep learning hardware and software to develop a new open-source VLSI placement engine, DREAMPlace [DAC’19], which is over 30x faster than the previous SOTA academic placer with similar quality of results. I will then present MAGICAL (Machine Generated Analog IC Layout) system, funded by the DARPA IDEA program to produce fully automated, no-human-in-the-loop analog layouts from netlists to GDSII with very promising results [ICCAD’19]. I will further show how we leverage recent AI breakthrough in generative adversarial network (GAN) to develop end-to-end lithography modeling with orders of magnitude speedup [DAC’19, ISPD’20]. The closed-loop between AI and IC will be discussed.

            <t>Plug-in Use of Machine Learning and Beyond</t>
          </p>
          <p>
          The wave of machine learning splashes to almost every corner of the world and EDA is no exception. 
Indeed, machine learning brings significant improvement over conventional EDA in various places. 
On the other hand, the applications of machine learning tend to be straightforward plug-in use, largely 
due to the poor explicability of many ML techniques. Nevertheless, we believe that the merit of ML EDA research
hinges on deep interactions with domain knowledge and customizations wherever possible. To this end,
two examples of such endeavor are presented. One is on functional verification acceleration and the other
is design rule violation prediction.

          </p>
          <p>
          I will talk about Once-for-All network for efficient neural architecture search. Conventional NAS methods are computationally prohibitive (causing 
CO2 emission as much as 5 cars’ lifetime) thus unscalable. In this work, we propose to train a Once-for-All Network (OFA, ICLR’20) that can specialize for different hardware platforms without retraining. It consistently outperforms state-of-the-art NAS methods including MobileNet-v3 and EfficientNet, while reducing many orders of magnitude GPU hours and CO2 emission, receiving the 1st place in the 3rd and 4th Low Power Computer Vision Challenge (LPCVC). I will also talk about ProxylessNAS that received the 1st place in the Google Visual Wake Works challenge and has been integrated by the research community including PyTorch and AutoGluon.

Recently he is interested in AutoML and NAS methods for efficient TinyML models. He received the best paper award at the ICLR’16 and FPGA’17. He is a recipient of NSF CAREER Award and MIT Technology Review Innovators Under 35. Many of the pruning, compression, and acceleration techniques have been integrated into commercial AI chips. He was the co-founder and chief scientist of DeePhi Tech (acquired by Xilinx). He earned a PhD in electrical engineering from Stanford University.

            <t>Pin Access Optimization Using Machine Learning</t>
          </p>
          <p>
          With the development of advanced process nodes of semiconductor, the problem of pin access has become one of the major factors to impact the occurrences of design rule violations (DRVs) due to complex design rules and limited routing resource. To tackle this problem, many recent works apply machine learning-based techniques to predict whether a local region has DRV or not by regarding global routing (GR) congestion and local pin density as the main features during the training process. Empirically, however, DRV occurrence is not necessary to be strongly correlated with the two features in advanced nodes. In this talk, I will present two of our works on DRV prediction using pin patterns as the major feature and model-guided placement refinement for DRV reduction [DAC’19, ISPD’20].
